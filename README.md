# FlickrImagesChallenge

This is a simple application that allows a user to search Flickr for images.  It  presents a user with a search bar
and executes searches on keyboard input. The user can enter text into the search bar and
see a grid of images whose tags match a search string. The search string can be a single word
or comma-separated words. When the user changes the text in the search bar, uthe grid of images is updated.

Additional features:
- Dynamic text support
- Support for landscape orientation
- A button to share the image
